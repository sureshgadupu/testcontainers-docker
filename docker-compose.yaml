# A Docker Compose must always start with the version tag.
# We use '3.3' because it's the last version.
#version: '3.3'

# You should know that Docker Compose works with services.
# 1 service = 1 container.
# For example, a service, a server, a client, a database...
# We use the keyword 'services' to start to create services.
services:
  # The name of our service is "postgres"
  # but you can use the name of your choice.
  # Note: This may change the commands you are going to use a little bit.
  postgres:
    # Official Postgres image from DockerHub
    image: 'postgres:13.2'

    # By default, a Postgres database is running on the 5432 port.
    # If we want to access the database from our computer (outside the container),
    # we must share the port with our computer's port.
    # The syntax is [port we want on our machine]:[port we want to retrieve in the container]
    # Note: You are free to change your computer's port,
    # but take into consideration that it will change the way
    # you are connecting to your database.

      - 5436:5432
